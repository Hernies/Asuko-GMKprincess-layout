# Asuko GMKprincess layout
Coleman-DH mod for international use (Spanish and English).

I made this layout for my GMK67, a 65% keyboard, this repo is so I or anyone else can set up my layout on any linux xorg-based system. Only the .xmodmap file is necesary but since I enjoy having multiple layouts i also set up a ubuntu custom keyboard layout.

It is useful for programming too since it has the US-ANSI symbol layout (for the most part). Layout inspired by reddit user u/simianeditions from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Colemak/comments/v7jzj4/colemak_in_spanish_dh_mod/).
